4. Visual Studio Code

### Setup

```shell
git clone https://github.com/kondratyev-nv/vscode-python-test-adapter
cd vscode-python-test-adapter

python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

### Incremental Build

You can also compile from the command-line:

### Validate your changes

To test the changes you launch a development version of VS Code on the workspace vscode, which you are currently editing.
Use the `Run extension` launch option.

To run tests run `Extension tests` launch option. It will execute integration tests for **both** Python 2 and Python 3, thus `python` and `python3` commands should be available to run and `pytest` module should be importable. Results of the tests are shown in Debug Console.
